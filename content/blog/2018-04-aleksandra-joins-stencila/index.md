We have a new addition to our team! Aleksandra Pawlik joined Stencila in April 2018 as our Community Advocate. Her role will focus on understanding users’ needs to direct further Stencila development, building open source developer community and keeping you all updated on what goes on in Stencila.

Aleksandra has been working in the research software area for over 6 years coordinating training for the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/) in the UK and then for the [New Zealand eScience Infrastructure](https://www.nesi.org.nz/). Aleksandra is a [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) certified instructor and has trained other instructors in Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

When she’s not working on making researchers’ life easier, Aleksandra is rock climbing, skiing, hiking and attempting to surf. She’s enjoying most of these activities all over her beloved Aotearoa - New Zealand.

You can find Aleksandra through her [email](mailto:aleksandra@stenci.la), at [Stencila Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/stencila/stencila) or on Twitter [@aleksandrana](https://twitter.com/aleksandrana).
