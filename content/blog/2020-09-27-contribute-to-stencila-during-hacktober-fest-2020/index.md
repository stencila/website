The leaves are changing colours, spooky decorations are sprouting up all over the place, and the cafes are offering seasonal drinks. This can only mean one thing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)!

Hacktoberfest is a month long event where you can contribute to open source projects you care about, and get rewarded in the process! This year the organizers of the event allow you to choose from receiving a limited edition T-Shirt, or plant a tree to help the enviornment. As all of our projects are open source, any pull requests (PRs) you contribute which gets merged will get you closer to receiving a reward.

To help get you started we've [created a list](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/issues/798) of approachable issues which we need help with.
