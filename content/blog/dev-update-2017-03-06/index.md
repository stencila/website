Michael and Oliver from [Substance](http://substance.io) are in New Zealand working with Nokome for a few weeks. Last week we started on the new minimal, editing experience for Stencila Documents. At this stage, it still only allows for the usual static content that you find in most word processors - but with an interface more like that of Medium. But we've also started working on reimplementing dynamic code cells and are looking forward to sharing that with you next week! Check out the [quick preview on YouTube](https://youtu.be/rouGFGSJ7OA).
