The option to create an [Executable Research Article (ERA)](https://elifesciences.org/labs/dc5acbde) is now available at eLife, taking published research to a new level of transparency, reproducibility and interactivity. Authors with a published eLife paper can register their interest to enhance their articles with live code blocks, programmatically-generated interactive figures, and dynamically generated in-line values.

We invite you to learn more about the process of creating an ERA by joining the eLife webinar on September 8th at 4pm BST ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2020-09-08/16:00)). This will include a demonstration of the author workflow to create an ERA by Innovation Community Manager, Emmy Tsang, and will be followed by a Q&A session with members of the eLife and Stencila team, where you will be able to ask any questions you may have.

The webinar will follow an open agenda and will be recorded. Links to the recording and notes will be shared on this page, within a week after the webinar.

We hope to see you there!
