We are proud to present the first batch of Stencila stickers!

![Stencila stickers](stickers-stencila.jpg)

No open source project is complete without stickers. We ordered our first batch of stickers and will definitely follow up with more.
As you can see we have a new logo or, in fact, a whole set of logos to represent Stencila Article and Stencila Sheets. With this
different shapes and colours we will pursue more sticker designs.

We will be giving out Stencila stickers to our beta testers. So if you want to decorate your laptops, [get in touch](mailto:aleksandra@stenci.la) and become
one of our beta testers.
