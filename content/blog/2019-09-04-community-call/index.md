In our September community call, Ben demoed his work on Stencila's execution engines, which allow us to process reproducible documents and enable collaboration between researchers working in different software, languages, and document formats.

Jacqueline shared new themes in Thema, our semantic HTML styling library for articles converted using our Stencila CLI and Encoda. She also showed mockups for our latest project, _Stencila /open_.
