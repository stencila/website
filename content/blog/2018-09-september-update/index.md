It's been a quiet few weeks on our blog but very busy time at Stencila. We have been working on further development of Stencila Hub which allows for easy collaboration and sharing of Stencila projects. Since the Hub runs on the cloud, it also takes away the overhead of having to install and maintain language- and domain-specific packages.

![Work in progress](work-in-progress.jpg){style="width: 60%; padding-right: 1em; float:left;" }

We are building the Hub using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. We went with Django because it has been out there for a while, it has a reasonably large community and is well documented. Since the Hub is, just like all Stencila components, open source, we aim to make contributing to it as easy as possible.

There are a number of [issues](https://github.com/stencila/hub/issues) in the GitHub repository marked as `Novice friendly` which hopefully will be a good start for those who would like to contribute and also improve their Django and Python programming skills.
