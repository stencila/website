  Stencila visited the University of Oregon. We met up with the Data Services staff and had a peek look into the Research
  Library. Our workshop brought us a lot of useful feedback, with particular focus on Stencila Sheets.

Today we drove from Portland down to the college town of Eugene, Oregon where we were hosted by the University of Oregon Data Services Librarian [Jonathan Cain](http://walecain.com/) and Digital Metadata Collections Librarian [Sarah Seymore](https://twitter.com/SarahESeymore).

Sarah showed us around the [Alan Price Science Commons and Research Library](https://library.uoregon.edu/price-science-commons-research-library).

And kicked things off on the BIG SCREEN. Spreadsheets have never looked so good!

After an engaging and informative session with lots of post it notes, good questions, and feedback - more on that in a later post - we toured the [DeArmond MakerSpace](https://library.uoregon.edu/scilib/psc-dearmond-makerspace). Our tour guide, [Melissa Galvan](https://around.uoregon.edu/student-jobs-melissa-galvan) schooled us on laser cutters, 3D printers, laser scanners, fancy sewing machines, milling machines and more - thanks Melissa for an awesome tour!
