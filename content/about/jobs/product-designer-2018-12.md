title: Product designer
---

Join a team developing the next-generation of tools for data-driven scientific discovery. Stencila aims to lower the barriers to reproducible research and enable collaboration between researchers with different levels of technical expertise. We're looking for a full-time UX/UI designer to lead the design and testing of novel user interfaces for data exploration, visualization and analysis.

## About you

- You are passionate about understanding how our users think, what their problems are, and building engaging user experiences that solve those problems.
- You are a designer who knows what it takes to build modern, responsive user interfaces - your thinking doesn’t stop at mock ups, it extends into build and deploy.
- You are keen to join in-person user workshops, value user feedback, and act upon it.
- Are committed to open-source and know from experience what it takes to grow a community around open-source software.
- Have a strong bias towards getting it done; you choose completion over perfection. You get a buzz out of getting things shipped.
- Take initiative, ownership and responsibility; you don’t need to wait for permission, don’t mind admitting you were wrong, and fix things when you are.
- Want to work as part of a diverse team with complementary skills; you give support and take advice.
- Comfortable working across time zones as part of a small, remote, geographically distributed team. You review asynchronous feedback, and get to work independently.
- You are comfortable regularly communicating on wins, progress, and roadblocks.

## Your Skills & Experience

- You are experienced in designing, deploying and testing user interfaces, preferably those for data driven discovery.
- An excellent communicator and facilitator able to translate users needs into implementable mockups and actionable technical requirements.
- You are proficient with HTML and CSS and have a beautiful portfolio that shows it.
- You have excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal.
- It’s a nice-to-have if you have a research or science background working with data.

## About us

- [Stencila](https://stenci.la) is building a toolbox of modular, interoperable software components for researchers ranging from Stencila [Dockter](https://github.com/stencila/dockter) (a command line tool that makes it easier to create Docker images) to Stencila [Hub](https://hub.stenci.la) (a web app that integrates our tools with third party services like Github and Dropbox) - and plenty of others in between!
- We're passionate about making data-driven discovery more accessible to more people and closing the gaps in collaboration between coders and non-coders.
- We’re obsessed with building tools that make simple thing easy and complex things possible.
- With funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation we are building a core team to take Stencila from a prototype to production.
- We are a small diverse, 100% remote, 100% open-source team linked to a broad open source and open science community.
- Stencila is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, citizenship, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital or family status, veteran status, or disability. We work hard to accommodate the needs of our team members and community.

## Examples of things you’ll do

- Lead the design of our user interfaces from research, concept and validation through to documentation, implementation, testing and deployment.
- Organise and facilitate collaborative design sessions with users.
- Research the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and developer experience (DX) of our tools, and other similar tools. Prepare your research as a report for the team and a blogpost that can be shared openly.
- Users are telling us they have problem X or want feature Y. How do other tools solve this problem or provide this feature? Summarise your research and share it as a mocked up proposal to the team and the community.
- Do usability testing to truly understand users needs and problems. What is confusing to them? What gets in their way? What things should we take away? What should we add?
- Mockup new (and refined) user interfaces, and get feedback from users, the rest of the team and the broader community. Lots of bonus points if you can start implementing the feature in coordination with our front-end engineer!
- What’s our developer onboarding experience like? Talk to 3 - 5 open source contributors and find out what friction points exist in our API and documentation.

## What’s unique about this job?

- Be part of a unique team working with scientists and other researchers to make data-driven research more open, effective, and reproducible.
- Opportunities to connect with a global community of people working on open source software for science and scholarship, including Code for Science & Society, Collaborative Knowledge Foundation, eLife, Substance, and more!

## Compensation

- US \$100,000 / year
