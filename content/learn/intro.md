Stencila provides a set of open-source software components enabling reproducible research within the tool of your choice. Stencila allows you to write reproducible
documents containing interactive source code using the interfaces you are most familiar with. Stencila components can be combined in various ways and plugged
into existing reproducible infrastructure.

## Execution engine

Stencila execution engine is its heart. The engine enables a spreadsheet-like, reactive programming model. It maintains a graph of the dependency between code cells.
This means that as you change your code or data, all other parts of your document depending on them get updated as well. Stencila execution engine does not itself
execute the code embedded in the documents but instead sends it to the execution contexts.

## Execution contexts{style="clear: left;"}

The execution contexts _compile_ and _execute_ code from the code cells that the execution engine passes on. This means that Stencila can
be used for practically any programming language as the execution contexts can be developed using Stencila API. Currently we provide execution contexts
for R, Python, JavaScript, SQL and Mini (Stencila's own simple language).

The execution contexts determine the inputs and outputs of cells which enables automatic conversion of data between languages. In other words, you can
combine multiple languages in one document.

## Encoda

Stencila includes a set of encoders/decoders which allow you to convert between a range of formats commonly used among researchers. Encoda supports lossless conversion of interactive source code sections and (most of the time) formatting.{style="display: block;"}

You can convert to and from formats used by:

- Excel (_xlsx_, _csv_, _tsv_),
- Jupyter Notebooks (_ipynb_),
- Markdown (_md_),
- RMarkdown (_Rmd_),
- Word (_docx_),
- LaTeX (_tex_),
- publishing applications (_JATS_, _xml_),
- and more...

Encoda bridges formats commonly used across the workflow lifecycle, e.g. from Jupyter Notebook to RMarkdown to Word to JATS. It makes the collaboration more
seamless and less painful.
