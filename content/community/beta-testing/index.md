# Beta Testing programme

> We are currently redesigning the Stencila Beta Testing programme. A set of tools for Beta Testing will be available in the second quarter of 2019. If you would like to become a Beta Tester, please [register your interest](https://forms.gle/1k4BKRMBXqQnVQZWA). We will get back to you with more information and the timeline for the planned launch of the Beta Testing programme. <br /> Thank you for your time and help!

> In the meantime, please come and join us on our [Community Forum](https://community.stenci.la/)
> or on our [Zulip chat channel](https://stencila.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/202396-community).

# Why Beta Testing

The Beta Testing programme helps get Stencila ready for general use. Testing focuses on capturing any issues that may exist with the software. But,
we also need you to tell us what improvements you would like to see! Stencila is an open source community-driven project and community input
is crucial for further development.

We invite everyone to join our Beta Testing programme. Any level of feedback is valuable and helps improve Stencila.
We want your experience as a Stencila Beta Tester to be as enjoyable as possible, so we will provide you with guidance on how to
proceed. We are of course open to all ideas and are very happy for Beta Testers to take initiative and test Stencila
through new changes.

# What's in it for you?

- You get your say on how Stencila should look, feel and work.
- You get experience as a software tester and learn how to report issues using GitHub (which is commonly used among open source projects).
- You become a part of the [Stencila community](index.html), which we aim to be inclusive and diverse, helping everyone who wants to join an open source movement.
  And we hope you will stay with us!
