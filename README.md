# Stencila Website

This is Stencila's marketing website deployed at `stencila.io`. It was bootstrapped from the "Salient" [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) template which uses:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - the official Tailwind CSS documentation
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - the official Next.js documentation
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev) - the official Headless UI documentation

## Getting started

To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website. You can modify the files in the `/src` folder and the site will auto-update.

## License

The original site template is a commercial product and is licensed under the [Tailwind UI license](https://tailwindui.com/license). We may open source this repo in the future.
