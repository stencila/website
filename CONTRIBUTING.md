## Contribute to Stencila website

Did you spot a typo or another mistake? Do you have a suggestion for a better wording?
Would you like to write a blog post for Stencila? Here's how to do it.

### Improve existing contents

Improving the existing contents is very easy!

1. At the bottom of the page you want to improve click on the _Edit_ link.
2. You will be taken to [the GitHub repository for this website](stencila-website-repo) with the page's contents open in an editor.
3. Go ahead and edit. Most pages are written using [Markdown](markdown).
4. Once you are done, scroll down to the bottom. Put in some information why you made under
   _Propose file change_.
5. Click the green button `Propose file change`
6. One of the website maintainers will review your suggestion and, if everything is OK,
   will publish it on the website.

If you want to make more substantive changes please check out [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)
which provides an outline of the site and the goals of each area, page and section.

### Blog posts

We invite guest blog posts from all community members. You can add a blog post
either via [emailing us](mailto:hello@stenci.la) the text of your blog or
by sending us a pull request. Here is how to do the latter:

1. Fork the [Stencila website repository](https://github.com/stencila/website).
2. Create a new branch where you will write your blog post.
3. In the [`blog`](blog) create a new **folder** for your post with a meaningful name e.g. `stencila-for-economics` or `stencila-for-phd` (it will be easier to find your blog post through search engines).
4. In the folder, create a new Markdown file called `index.md`.
5. Start editing the `index.md` file by adding the [YAML front matter](http://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html) at the very top,
   like in the example below:

```
---
extends: blog/_post.html
title: Using Stencila for research in economics
author: Jane Doe and Joe Bloggs
date: 6 April 2018
abstract: A summary of my post
---

The start of my post on a very interesting subject...
```

You can optionally add an `image` item (e.g. `image: my-photo.jpg`, a relative path to an image) to the front matter to force the blog index to use a particular image for your post. If you don't specify and image, it will just choose the first image (in alphabetical order, if there are any images in the post's folder.

**Note** Please use a YAML front matter as shown below, providing
some meta data about your blog post. This allows for correct rendering and
publishing of your post, attributing the authorship and makes the post
easy to search within the search engines.

6. Write your blog post!
7. Commit, push the branch to your fork and submit your pull request.
