    Title: Founder & CEO
    Avatar: /img/team/nokome-bentley.jpg
    Bio: |
      Nokome is the founder of Stencila. He is originally a marine
      scientist with over twenty years experience in research for
      sustainable management of marine resources. Stencila is a
      project born out of Nokome’s own frustrations with traditional
      copy and paste workflows and the inaccessibility of many
      existing tools for data-driven research. He set out to create
      a platform for reproducible research that bridges the gap in
      collaboration between coders and non-coders. Nokome is based
      in Aotearoa New Zealand.
