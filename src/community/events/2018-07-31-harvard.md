This session will present Stencila  which comes with interface familiar to that of word
processor and spreadsheet application. At the same time, Stencila is interoperable with the existing tools for reproducible research. Nokome Bentley the original creator
of the tool will give the overview of Stencila, walk the participants through a demo of the software, and lead into a discussion around potential future directions.

This video is a short demonstration of a simple example using R in Stencila Sheets:

Stencila is an open source project funded by a [grant from the Sloan Foundation](http://stenci.la/blog/sloan-grant/). We are building a tool which enables researchers collaborate on data analysis using programming languages but not having to give up their tool of choice. During this session we would like to collect more user feedback and hear back from you what features you would find most useful.
