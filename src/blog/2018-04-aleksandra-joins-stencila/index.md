Aleksandra has been working in the research software area for over 6 years coordinating training for the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/) in the UK and then for the [New Zealand eScience Infrastructure](https://www.nesi.org.nz/). Aleksandra is a [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) certified instructor and has trained other instructors in Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

When she’s not working on making researchers’ life easier, Aleksandra is rock climbing, skiing, hiking and attempting to surf. She’s enjoying most of these activities all over her beloved Aotearoa - New Zealand.

You can find Aleksandra through her [email](mailto:aleksandra@stenci.la), at [Stencila Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/stencila/stencila) or on Twitter [@aleksandrana](https://twitter.com/aleksandrana).
