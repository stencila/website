                  Founder and CEO

                <p>
                  Nokome is the founder of Stencila. He is originally a marine
                  scientist with over twenty years experience in research for
                  sustainable management of marine resources. Stencila is a
                  project born out of Nokome’s own frustrations with traditional
                  copy and paste workflows and the inaccessibility of many
                  existing tools for data-driven research. He set out to create
                  a platform for reproducible research that bridges the gap in
                  collaboration between coders and non-coders. Nokome is based
                  in Aotearoa New Zealand.
